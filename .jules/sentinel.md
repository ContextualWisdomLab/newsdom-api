## 2025-02-14 - Fix Insecure File Upload via Missing Magic Byte Check
**Vulnerability:** The `/parse` endpoint verified file types exclusively using the `Content-Type` header, omitting payload inspection. This allowed bypassing checks by supplying malicious payloads with an `application/pdf` header.
**Learning:** Checking headers is insufficient; APIs consuming binary data must validate content via magic bytes (e.g., `b"%PDF-"`) and structural parsing before processing.
**Prevention:** Always inspect magic bytes for binary upload endpoints and reject structurally invalid payloads before handing data to downstream parsers.

## 2024-06-25 - Prevent DoS from unbounded file read
**Vulnerability:** The `/parse` API reads the entire uploaded PDF into memory using `await file.read()`. If an attacker uploads a massive file, it can cause an Out-Of-Memory (OOM) error, leading to Denial of Service (DoS).
**Learning:** FastAPI `UploadFile.read()` loads the entire file into memory unless limited. Even if it's spooled to disk by FastAPI initially, calling `.read()` buffers it fully into memory. Since this goes to MinerU which might process it for a while, large files cause severe memory exhaustion.
**Prevention:** Implement an application-level file size limit during the upload read process using `file.size`.
## 2025-02-14 - [Unsafe Upload Filename Risk]
**Vulnerability:** Client-supplied filenames uploaded via FastAPI were used to name temporary files passed to the MinerU CLI. Even with `subprocess.run(..., shell=False)`, weak filename normalization can leave path traversal fragments, unsafe filesystem characters, confusing option-like names, or brittle artifact names.
**Learning:** Removing null bytes and path separators is not enough for filesystem and CLI integration boundaries; filenames should be reduced to a small, predictable character set before they influence paths or downstream tool arguments.
**Prevention:** Apply a strict regex allowlist (e.g., `re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z0-9_.-]', '_', filename)`) to user-supplied filenames before using them for temporary files or CLI arguments.

## 2026-06-26 - Add Referrer-Policy Security Header
**Vulnerability:** The API lacked a `Referrer-Policy` header, potentially leaking sensitive information in the URL to external domains if a user navigates away from the application.
**Learning:** Adding a `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` header is a simple yet effective defense-in-depth measure that prevents the browser from sending the `Referer` header.
**Prevention:** Include `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` in the global security headers middleware to consistently enforce this protection across all endpoints.

## 2026-06-29 - Prevent Information Leakage via Exception Chaining
**Vulnerability:** Exception chaining (`from exc`) when raising `HTTPException` attached internal exceptions (like `PdfReadError` or `MineruRuntimeUnavailableError`) to the resulting HTTP error object.
**Learning:** While FastAPI does not leak chained exceptions in default responses, relying on this behavior is risky. Custom error handlers, logging middleware, or changes in the framework could unintentionally expose these chained tracebacks to clients, leaking sensitive internal logic or paths.
**Prevention:** Use `from None` instead of `from exc` when mapping internal exceptions to user-facing `HTTPException`s to explicitly suppress the exception context and avoid attaching internal stack traces.
