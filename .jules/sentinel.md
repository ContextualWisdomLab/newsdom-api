## 2025-02-14 - Fix Insecure File Upload via Missing Magic Byte Check
**Vulnerability:** The `/parse` endpoint verified file types exclusively using the `Content-Type` header, omitting payload inspection. This allowed bypassing checks by supplying malicious payloads with an `application/pdf` header.
**Learning:** Checking headers is insufficient; APIs consuming binary data must validate content via magic bytes (e.g., `b"%PDF-"`) and structural parsing before processing.
**Prevention:** Always inspect magic bytes for binary upload endpoints and reject structurally invalid payloads before handing data to downstream parsers.
